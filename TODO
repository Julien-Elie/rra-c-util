                          rra-c-util To-Do List

portable:

 * Include the krbafs portability layer from kstart and pam-afs-session
   and add a test suite for it.

util:

 * Include messages-krb5.c from the kstart distribution.  Consider
   providing an API to retrieve the most recent Kerberos error message in
   addition to just die_krb5() and warn_krb5().

Test Suite:

 * Add a bail_krb5() function to tests/tap/kerberos.c that bails out but
   provides the Kerberos error message.  This requires messages-krb5.c and
   that the functions providing the Kerberos message be public.

 * The xmalloc test suite doesn't fully comply with the TAP output
   protocol when reporting diagnostics from the xmalloc helper program.
