                          rra-c-util To-Do List

General:

 * Provide tools to dynamically generate system.h, krb5.h, krb5-extra.c,
   kadmin.h, and any other files whose complete contents are not
   relevant to every package.

 * Look for duplication with gnulib (under an acceptable license) and
   remove some portability code here in favor of gnulib.

 * Use krb5_free_string for appdefaults code.

util:

 * Provide an API in util/messages-krb5.c to retrieve the most recent
   Kerberos error message.

TAP Add-Ons:

 * Check the Kerberos password if password was requested and abort if
   authentication fails.

Test Suite:

 * The xmalloc test suite doesn't fully comply with the TAP output
   protocol when reporting diagnostics from the xmalloc helper program.

 * Incorporate the Perl utility library from kstart's test suite.

Documentation:

 * Write POD documentation for all public interfaces.

 * Move the comments at the start of some of the util/* source files into
   proper POD documentation.

 * Document the Kerberos API provided.

 * Write a guide to Kerberos portability.

 * Add coding style guides to this package.
