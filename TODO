                          rra-c-util To-Do List

util:

 * Provide an API in util/messages-krb5.c to retrieve the most recent
   Kerberos error message.

Test Suite:

 * The xmalloc test suite doesn't fully comply with the TAP output
   protocol when reporting diagnostics from the xmalloc helper program.

 * Incorporate the Perl utility library from kstart's test suite.

 * Generalize the pod-t and pod-spelling-t test cases to be easier to copy
   into other packages without modifications.

Documentation:

 * Write POD documentation for all public interfaces.

 * Move the comments at the start of some of the util/* source files into
   proper POD documentation.
