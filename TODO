                          rra-c-util To-Do List

General:

 * Add notices to every file meant to be copied into other packages saying
   that the file originated in rra-c-util and pointing to the rra-c-util
   distribution page.

util:

 * Provide an API in util/messages-krb5.c to retrieve the most recent
   Kerberos error message.

Test Suite:

 * Add a bail_krb5() function to tests/tap/kerberos.c that bails out but
   provides the Kerberos error message.  This requires messages-krb5.c and
   that the functions providing the Kerberos message be public.

 * The xmalloc test suite doesn't fully comply with the TAP output
   protocol when reporting diagnostics from the xmalloc helper program.

 * Incorporate the Perl utility library from kstart's test suite.
