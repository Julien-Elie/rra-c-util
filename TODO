                          rra-c-util To-Do List

Deprecations:

 * Drop m4/pcre.m4 now that m4/pcre2.m4 exists.

General:

 * Provide tools to dynamically generate system.h, krb5.h, krb5-extra.c,
   kadmin.h, and any other files whose complete contents are not
   relevant to every package.

 * Look for duplication with gnulib (under an acceptable license) and
   remove some portability code here in favor of gnulib.

 * Add a gnulib-style synchronization tool to include the latest version
   of the code in a package.

 * Use krb5_free_string for appdefaults code.

 * Support clean compilation with GCC -Wsign-conversion.

Autoconf probes:

 * Check the usability of headers in library probes and treat the library
   as not found if the header isn't available.

 * Use m4/lib-helper.m4 for all library probes.

 * Support other bit sizes for PCRE2 besides 8-bit.

Portability layer:

 * Add long option support to getopt (possibly by using gnulib instead).

 * Add a replacement for strtonum.

 * Use getauxval(AT_SECURE) in issetugid replacement if available.

Utility functions:

 * Provide an API in util/messages-krb5.c to retrieve the most recent
   Kerberos error message.

TAP add-ons:

 * Check the Kerberos password if password was requested and abort if
   authentication fails.

 * Add support for setting up a network namespace so that tests using
   localhost can be done in that namespace and be guaranteed not to
   interfere with any services running on the host and listening on
   localhost.  This message to libc-alpha has code to do this:
   https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2016-12/msg01058.html

 * Add support for setting up a UID/GID namespace and running tests under
   it, equivalent to fakeroot support (but using newer kernel features).

Build system:

 * Support an --enable-rpath configure flag that adds the library
   directories to the RPATH of built binaries (requested for libkopenafs).

Test suite:

 * The xmalloc test suite doesn't fully comply with the TAP output
   protocol when reporting diagnostics from the xmalloc helper program.

 * Incorporate the Perl utility library from kstart's test suite, or
   use Authen::Kerberos if it's far enough along to support the
   required functions.

Documentation:

 * Write POD documentation for all public interfaces.

 * Move the comments at the start of some of the util/* source files into
   proper POD documentation.

 * Document the Kerberos API provided.

 * Write a guide to Kerberos portability.

 * Add coding style guides to this package.
