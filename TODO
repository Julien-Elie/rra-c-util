                          rra-c-util To-Do List

util:

 * Add a timeout argument to the network_connect functions that, if set,
   uses a non-blocking connect and select to enforce a connection
   timeout.

 * Provide an API in util/messages-krb5.c to retrieve the most recent
   Kerberos error message.

Test Suite:

 * Add test cases for network_bind_all properly binding separate addresses
   for IPv4 and IPv6 on systems where IPv6 is supported.

 * Add a bail_krb5() function to tests/tap/kerberos.c that bails out but
   provides the Kerberos error message.  This requires messages-krb5.c and
   that the functions providing the Kerberos message be public.

 * The xmalloc test suite doesn't fully comply with the TAP output
   protocol when reporting diagnostics from the xmalloc helper program.

 * Incorporate the Perl utility library from kstart's test suite.
