                     User-Visible rra-c-util Changes

rra-c-util 1.0

    Initial public release based on the portability code that shipped with
    remctl 2.13 with some additional files from other current releases of
    my software packages.  The changes below are relative to that version.

    Separate out the message functions that call exit to a separate source
    file and therefore a separate object file.  This will mean that shared
    libraries that don't call die won't link this file and hence won't
    include a reference to exit, which will avoid errors from some package
    test tools.

    On BSD/OS, despite the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag being present in the system
    headers, passing it into getaddrinfo results in an error.  Test for
    this at configure time and, if it doesn't work, hide the system
    AI_ADDRCONFIG definition.

    Remove RRA_LIB_*_SET functions.  When using Automake, one should never
    put one's own flags into the CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, and LDFLAGS variables,
    since the user may override them.  Instead, AM_* versions should be
    set in Makefile.am.  This can be done using the existing substitution
    variables, so the *_SET functions were always wrong.

    Declare message_fatal_cleanup extern in util.h.  Fixes compilation
    problems on Mac OS X and probably elsewhere.

    Change from AC_TRY_* to AC_*_IFELSE for all Autoconf macros.

    Update the example configure.ac for Autoconf 2.63, adding
    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR and using AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS instead of
    AC_AIX and AC_GNU_SOURCE.

    Specify a mode when creating a sentinel in the daemon test.  This
    fixes compiler warnings with newer gcc.
