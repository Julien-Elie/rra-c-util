To run the full test suite, and to use the Perl test support libraries,
Perl 5.8 or later is required.  The following additional Perl modules will
be used if present:

* Devel::Cover
* IPC::System::Simple
* Test::MinimumVersion
* Test::Perl::Critic
* Test::Pod
* Test::Pod::Coverage
* Test::Spelling
* Test::Strict
* Test::Synopsis

All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules are
not available.
